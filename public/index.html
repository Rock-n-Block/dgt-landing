      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

The idea is that users will decide to promote and support the projects they're most interested in, instead of being in the passenger seat. Like the concept of blockchain and its decentralization, Web3 is all about redistributing power to users. We will help you create a marketing action plan that will help you build a strong community of investors and ambassadors who are ready to pick out your project from others."
